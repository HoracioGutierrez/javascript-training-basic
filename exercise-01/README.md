# Exercise 01

This exercise is about the DOM. You simply need to select an element on the page (there's not much to select) and then print the text content of the element in the console. After that, you need to change the text content of the element.

Suggested steps:

1. Use the `document.querySelector()` method to select any element on the page.
1. Use the `textContent` property to get the text content of the element.
1. Use the `console.log()` method to print the text content of the element in the console.
